		<description><![CDATA[Would be awesome to see e2e testing compared to system testing &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; UAT. I know, an experience engineer wouldn&#039;t really  confuse the three, but then again, an experienced engineer wouldn&#039;t confuse e2e and system testing. As for beginners, I witnessed quite a few cases when folks were unable to tell the difference]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s just a good example. Gmail is a complex web application with lots of things going on under the hood. Besides, Gmail is a web application that most people can access. So, basically, anyone can do the same testing routine and see how Screenster works for them]]></description>
